Your React app with Tailwind CSS is now running!

## Additional Commands

```

## Troubleshooting

**If npm install fails:**
- Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 14+)
- Try deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` then run `npm install` again

**If images don't load:**
- Verify images are in `src/assets/images/`
- Check that image names match exactly (case-sensitive)

**If styles look wrong:**
- Make sure Tailwind is installed: `npm install tailwindcss`
- Rebuild: `npm run build`
